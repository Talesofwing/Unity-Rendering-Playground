# Unity-ScreenSpaceShadowMapping

> Unity 2021.3.20f1

I currently don't have a deep understanding of SSSM, so I will supplement my notes when more detailed shadows can be rendered later.

### Questions

1. How to make the camera cover the entire scene and obtain a high-quality shadow-map in the case of directional light source.
