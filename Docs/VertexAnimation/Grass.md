# Grass

## Introduction

This project implemented simple `vertex animation` and `billboard` effects to simulate grass. In the future, I will try to incorporate Noise textures to handle wind direction and implement `shadow-caster`.

## Usage
1. Play Unity
2. Click `Space` button to change wind direction
