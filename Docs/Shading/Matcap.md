# Matcap

Matcap is a 2D texture that encodes the material appearance of an object from a fixed camera viewpoint. It maps surface normals to a pre-rendered texture, enabling fast approximation of lighting and shading effects.

However, due to its inherent limitation of being view-dependent and lacking dynamic lighting interaction, Matcap is now considered an obsolete technique in modern real-time rendering workflow.
