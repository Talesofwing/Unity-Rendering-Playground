# Outline

There are various methods for rendering Outline, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Currently, I has not found a universal algorithm for Outline rendering. Depending on the requirements, different implementation approaches can be chosen.

There are mainly two methods to render Outline:
- Post-Processing
- Application to the model

3. [Outline-Based-Stencil](ApplicationToModel/OutlineBasedStencil.md)
4. [Outline-Based-Stencil-SmoothNormal](ApplicationToModel/OutlineBasedStencilSmoothNormal.md)

#### Post-Processing
